# nourish.run
The open-source MyFitnessPal alternative. Transforming human health and performance through optimal nutrition.

Current nutritional health platforms remain fraught with challenges â€“ low efficacy in helping users achieve their health goals, limited access due to financial and geographical barriers, a lack of community engagement and social features that promote accountability, and no transparency regarding data handling or the effectiveness of dietary recommendations.

Our goal at Nourish is to solve these challenges, enabling nutrition to be a cornerstone for transforming human health and performance.
